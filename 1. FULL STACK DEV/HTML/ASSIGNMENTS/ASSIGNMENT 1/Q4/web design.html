      <p>
        Web design encompasses many different skills and disciplines in the
        production and maintenance of websites. The different areas of web design
        include web graphic design; user interface design (UI design); authoring,
        including standardised code and proprietary software; user experience
        design (UX design); and search engine optimization.

        Often many individuals will work in teams covering different aspects of
        the design process, although some designers will cover them all.[1] The
        term "web design" is normally used to describe the design process relating
        to the front-end (client side) design of a website including writing
        markup. Web design partially overlaps web engineering in the broader scope
        of web development.

        Web designers are expected to have an awareness of usability and be up to
        date with web accessibility guidelines.
