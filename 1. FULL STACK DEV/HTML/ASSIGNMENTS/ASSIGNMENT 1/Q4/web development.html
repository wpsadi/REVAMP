           Welcome to the MDN learning area. This set of articles aims to guide
           complete beginners to web development with all that they need to start
           coding websites.
         </p>
         <p>
           The aim of this area of MDN is not to take you from "beginner" to "expert"
           but to take you from "beginner" to "comfortable." From there, you should
           be able to start making your way, learning from the rest of MDN, and other
           intermediate to advanced resources that assume a lot of previous
           knowledge.
         </p>
         <p>
           If you are a complete beginner, web development can be challenging â€” we
           will hold your hand and provide enough detail for you to feel comfortable
           and learn the topics properly. You should feel at home whether you are a
           student learning web development (on your own or as part of a class), a
           teacher looking for class materials, a hobbyist, or someone who just wants
           to understand more about how web technologies work.
