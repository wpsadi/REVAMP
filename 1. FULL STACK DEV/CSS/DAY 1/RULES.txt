Inline CSS : in the tags itself like ; like in paragraph tag of h1 tag;
Internal CSS : in the style tag in the head ;
Eternal CSS : in the new css file ;


Priority : inline > (internal = external)
externl and internal follow the order in which they are written
i.e., jo last me likha gya hai wahi satya hai


 use *** ! important *** to make that property a Priority

Cascading order : jo baad me likha gya hai whi satya hai

CSS specificity : Priority would be: inline > id > class > element
